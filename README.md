The app I created was an inventory management app designed to help users keep track of items in a warehouse or storage setting. It allows users to log items, organize them, and edit the details in an easy-to-navigate grid layout. The main user need, is it solves the issue by simplifying the process of managing inventory efficiently while being user-friendly.

The app includs a login screen for security, a home screen to view inventory in a grid, and options for adding, updating, and deleting items. I designed the UI with simplicity in mind, using clear input fields and intuitive navigation. I focused on ensuring the screens were uncluttered and easy to understand, with buttons and layouts that made sense to users. These designs were successful because they kept the user’s experience straightforward and hassle-free.

I broke the coding process into smaller, manageable steps. For example, I worked on the database setup first, then moved to the user interface and the functionality for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. I used clear naming conventions and added comments to make the code easier to follow. Regular testing as I completed each feature helped me fix bugs early and kept me organized.

I tested the app using the Android Emulator to ensure it worked on different Android versions. I checked each feature, like adding or updating items, to make sure it functioned correctly. This testing process was important because it helped me catch small errors, like layout misalignments or issues with database connections, before they could become bigger problems for the user.

One challenge I faced was ensuring the app worked seamlessly across various Android versions.. as well as the SMS activity, that blew my mind! Trying to get the authentication to go through while not transitioning to the grid layout immediately.

I’m especially proud of how I handled the grid layout for displaying inventory items. It looks clean, is easy to navigate, and effectively meets the users' needs. This part of the app really showcases my ability to design and implement a functional, user-friendly feature that feels polished.

Thanks for reading!
